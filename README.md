# ShopSymulation
Simulation of an online store in Python. 
The program generates pseudo-random data about the site's customers using its own random number generator. 

The program simulates the basic errors that may occur on the websites of online stores - both 4xx errors (client-side errors) and 5xx errors (server-side errors).

The data is both retrieved and saved in an Excel file.
